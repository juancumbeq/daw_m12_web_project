# TaskTeam üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

TaskTeam it the final project for my Certificate of the Higher Education in Web Application Development. It is a web-based task management system that allows efficient organization and tracking of employee tasks within a company. It features a user-friendly interface, and encompasses two main components: an employee management module and a task management module.

The employee management module enables the registration, viewing, editing, and deletion of employee records. It includes fields for employee details such as names, positions, and departments. Additionally, it provides login functionality for employees and department managers, ensuring secure access to the system.

The task management module allows the creation, assignment, and management of tasks associated with employees. Tasks can be searched, filtered, and sorted based on various criteria. Each task is linked to a specific employee and includes details such as task description, start and end dates, and status. This module provides an overview of the tasks assigned to each employee, facilitating effective task distribution and tracking.

The system features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, offering a different access login for employees or department managers, employee registration and editing forms, as well as a section dedicated to task management. Both employees and tasks can be searched and filtered by different criteria, facilitating their location and tracking. Additionally, the possibility of assigning tasks to specific employees, recording the start and end date of each task, and viewing a general summary of the tasks assigned to each employee is provided.

**TaskTeam** is developed using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL, aiming to create a robust and functional application. Furthermore, good design and programming practices are applied.

In summary, this web application aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for employee and task management, allowing companies to improve their internal organization, increase productivity, and optimize tracking of tasks assigned to their personnel.
